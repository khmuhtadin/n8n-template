## 📦 What You'll Find Here

This repository includes a growing collection of ready-to-use n8n workflow templates for a wide variety of use cases.

Each workflow is designed to be easy to import, modify, and run in your own n8n instance.

## 🛠 Requirements

- A running instance of n8n (self-hosted or cloud)
- Required credentials set up for each template (e.g. Twitter API keys, SMTP settings, etc.)
- ⚠️ **Some nodes require a publicly accessible IP address** for webhooks or external callbacks.  
  You can achieve this by:
  - Hosting n8n on a server with a public IP
  - Using tunneling services such as [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/) or [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo or download the JSON files you need.
2. Open your [n8n](https://n8n.io/) instance.
3. Import the JSON file via the n8n editor UI.
4. Customize credentials and parameters as needed.
5. Activate and run the workflow!
